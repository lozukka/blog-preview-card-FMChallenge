## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned:
1. How to look sizing and other detail information in Figma.
2. I became more comfortable with flex.
3. How to do box-shadow. I used a box-shadow generator to help with the correct numbers.

```css
.card{
box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px var(--color-gray-950);
}
```

### Continued development

I am not sure if it is "good HTML" to mark first a H2-tag, then a p-tag and then H1-tag. I don't know if that matters, but feels wrong. In the future I will learn more about accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Box Shadow Generator](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me with the box-shadow. I really liked how easy this was to use.
